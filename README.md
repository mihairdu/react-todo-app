# react-todo-app
Remake of an earlier version of a Todo List. This time, I'm using React and its functionalities such as States, Effects and JSX syntax to make a better Todo List, which looks just as good as the first one and operates even better, as the local storage now remembers all the Completed/Uncompletes tasks, by virtue of using states in React.
